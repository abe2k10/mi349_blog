      Hello! My name is <strong>Abe Mohamednoor</strong>. I work at Amazon as a Safety Representative
      and I am also a student at <em>Michigan State University</em>. I am majoring in Information Science
      and minoring in Environment & Health.
    </p>

    <p>
      At work, I focus on creating a safe environment for my team. I deal with things like
      safety checks, reporting issues, and encouraging coworkers to follow best practices.
      Safety might seem simple, but I have learned that even small improvements can prevent
      big problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      At MSU, I am passionate about how information systems and environmental health connect.
      My studies help me see how technology can be used to make communities healthier and more sustainable.
      Combining what I learn in the classroom with what I see at work gives me a unique perspective.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of school and work, I enjoy spending time with family, exploring new technology,
      and working on personal growth. Writing for this blog gives me the chance to reflect on
      my experiences and hopefully share something useful with others.
